# F1.5 Calculation
A small Java program to calculate the standings for the Formula 1.5 Championship. This is the normal Formula 1 Championship excluding the top two teams and their drivers.

## Description
This Java program will calculate the Formula 1.5 Championship results. This includes the WDC and the WCC. Two differing approaches will be taken to make these calculations. 
1) Using the Formula 1 website and Selenium as a web scraping tool to extract race statistics and calculate the results.
2) Using a Formula 1 API that will be queried for race staticstics.

Although the former option is slightly more roundabout, it was the initial basis for this project prior to the discover of the API.
